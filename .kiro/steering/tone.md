# Tone and Voice Guidelines for The Whisperbound Tome

All generated content must follow a restrained, archaic, ceremonial tone.

## Absolute Rules

### Forbidden
- No modern words (coined after 1900)
- No exclamation marks (!)
- No playful phrases
- No direct commands
- No enthusiasm or excitement

### Required
- Use passive voice
- Slow pacing with deliberate pauses
- Silence markers: — (em dash), … (ellipsis)
- Archaic vocabulary
- Ceremonial restraint
- Metaphors tied to nature, silence, and thresholds

## Writing Patterns

### Preferred Constructions
- "the spell is revealed" rather than "here's your spell"
- "what seeks to be released" rather than "what do you want to let go"
- "the path unfolds" rather than "click next"
- "silence holds the answer" rather than "wait for it"
- "threshold crossed" rather than "completed"

### Metaphorical Domains
Draw language from:
- **Nature**: roots, soil, water, stone, flame, wind, shadow
- **Silence**: pause, stillness, void, space between
- **Thresholds**: crossing, passage, doorway, veil, boundary
- **Time**: dusk, dawn, twilight, the turning of seasons
- **Elements**: earth, water, fire, air, void, light

### Forbidden Elements
- Exclamation marks (!)
- Modern slang (awesome, cool, great, etc.)
- Direct imperatives (click here, do this, you must)
- Overly casual language
- Technical jargon without mystical framing
- Enthusiasm that breaks the spell

## Examples

### UI Text
❌ "Click here to create your spell!"  
✅ "speak your intention into the silence"

❌ "Great job! You leveled up!"  
✅ "a threshold has been crossed… new mysteries await"

❌ "Delete this spell"  
✅ "release this inscription"

❌ "Next step"  
✅ "the path continues"

### Error Messages
❌ "Error: Please enter text"  
✅ "the grimoire awaits your whisper"

❌ "Invalid input"  
✅ "these words cannot be bound"

### Notifications
❌ "Achievement unlocked!"  
✅ "a seal has been broken"

❌ "You earned 10 XP"  
✅ "the tome remembers your practice"

## Code Comments
Even in code, maintain awareness of the project's voice:

```typescript
// ❌ // Check if user is logged in
// ✅ // Verify the practitioner's presence

// ❌ // Generate random spell
// ✅ // Weave intention into form

// ❌ // Save to database
// ✅ // Inscribe into the grimoire
```

## Commit Messages
Frame commits in the project's language:

❌ "Added new feature for spell creation"  
✅ "inscribed ritual for spell weaving"

❌ "Fixed bug in authentication"  
✅ "mended the threshold guardian"

❌ "Updated UI colors"  
✅ "deepened the arcane palette"

## Documentation
When writing docs, balance clarity with atmosphere:
- Technical accuracy remains paramount
- Wrap technical concepts in mystical language where appropriate
- Use metaphor to explain, not obscure
- Let the reader feel they're learning ancient knowledge, not just using software

## The Balance
Remember: the goal is immersion without confusion. The user should feel transported to a mystical space while still understanding how to use the application. Clarity serves the mystery, never obscures it.
